# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Forecasting

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread health, economic, and social challenges globally.
This project focuses on analyzing global and India-specific COVID-19 data to understand
infection trends, recovery patterns, and fatality rates, and to forecast future cases.

## Problem Statement
- Visualize the impact of COVID-19 across the world and in India.
- Analyze infection, recovery, and fatality trends.
- Predict the number of COVID-19 cases for the upcoming week using time-series forecasting.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Confirmed cases
- Deaths
- Recovered cases
- Date-wise global records
- Country-wise data with a focus on India

Data is provided in CSV/Excel format.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas – Data loading and preprocessing
- NumPy – Numerical computations
- Plotly – Interactive data visualizations
- Facebook Prophet – Time-series forecasting

## Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization of cumulative and daily trends
4. Calculation of recovery and fatality rates
5. Time-series forecasting using Prophet
6. Visualization of predicted results

## Visualizations
- Global and India cumulative confirmed, recovered, and death cases
- Daily new cases with 7-day rolling averages
- Recovery rate vs fatality rate trends
- Actual vs forecasted COVID-19 cases

## Forecasting
Facebook Prophet was used to predict confirmed COVID-19 cases for the next 7 days.
The model provides predicted values along with upper and lower confidence intervals.

## Results
- Clear identification of infection peaks
- Gradual improvement in recovery rates
- Stable fatality trends over time
- Accurate short-term forecasting results
